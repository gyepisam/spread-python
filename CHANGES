Release 1.6:  changes since release 1.5
---------------------------------------
Release date:  2005-MM-DD

- The documentation for ``spread.connect()`` gave incorrect names for the
  ``daemon`` and ``name`` arguments (important if you want to use them as
  keyword arguments), and wasn't clear that the hostname portion of the
  ``daemon`` argument is not optional on Windows.

- The documentation for a mailbox's ``poll()`` method claimed the result
  was 0 or 1.  It's actually the number of message bytes available to be
  read by a ``receive()`` call.


Release 1.5:  changes since release 1.5b1
-----------------------------------------
Release date:  2005-01-25

No changes since 1.5b1.


Release 1.5b1:  changes since release 1.5a1
-------------------------------------------

- Mailbox objects have a new multigroup_multicast() method, wrapping
  the Spread API's SP_multigroup_multicast() call.  Thanks to Mark McClain
  for contributing code, docs, and tests for this new feature.

- The C code was changed to suppress a nuisance warning from gcc.

Release 1.5a1:  changes since release 1.4
-----------------------------------------

- Zope collector issue http://zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1130
  "spreadmodule.c contains improper use of the 'sizeof' operator"

  Spread membership messages are complicated, and before Spread 3.17 it
  wasn't actually possible to decode them correctly in all cases.  For
  example, if the user changed Spread's MAX_PRIVATE_NAME, MAX_PROC_NAME,
  and MAX_GROUP_NAME #defines, there was no way to guess where various
  values began in the buffer SP_receive() was given, and segfaults
  or data loss could occur if you guessed wrong.

  This wasn't entirely fixed until Spread 3.17.2 (Spread itself could
  still segfault if the user changed these #defines), but at least
  3.17 introduced 3 new Spread API functions so that clients can determine
  where fields in the buffer begin.  The Python Spread wrapper module
  has been updated to use them.

- The module version() function is now documented.

- Changes to the build procedure on Windows for Spread 3.17.3 were
  incorporated (the names of some Spread files on Windows changed to match
  the names of corresponding files in non-Windows builds).


Release 1.4:  changes since release 1.3
---------------------------------------

- Added PyPI / Trove metadata to the package.

- Update to require Spread 3.17.1 (library names changed from 'libsp'
  and 'libtsp' to 'libspread' and 'libtspread').

- Documentation cleanup.

Release 1.3: changes since release 1.2
--------------------------------------

- Critical bugfix:  We didn't realize that the service_type argument to
  Spread's SP_receive() is an input parameter as well as an output
  parameter, and consequently didn't initialize it.  Depending on what
  trash happened to be sitting on the stack, this could cause Spread to
  deliberately drop data (a backward compatibility feature in Spread
  triggered by passing the DROP_RECV flag in service_type on input).


Release 1.2: changes since release 1.1
--------------------------------------

- Changed internal uses of Python's object memory API to stop using
  macro versions of the names (that worked fine, but was dubious
  practice for non-core extension modules).

- Changed mbox.disconnect() to be as safe as possible when
  SPREAD_DISCONNECT_RACE_BUG is not defined.

- Added a test to ensure than the scenario described below doesn't
  deadlock (two threads in a process sharing an mbox, and one thread
  doing mbox.receive() waiting for the other thread to do
  mbox.multicast()).  This test deadlocks with high probability if you
  define SPREAD_DISCONNECT_RACE_BUG.

- SPREAD_DISCONNECT_RACE_BUG is turned off, although Spread 3.16.2
  still suffers the insecurity it was guarding against.  Alas, the
  workaround can cause deadlocks, depending on how the app uses
  Spread.  See the message thread at:

  http://lists.spread.org/pipermail/spread-users/2002-April/000735.html

  for details.  If, for each mbox, your multithreaded app only does
  mbox.receive() from a single thread, and always use select() or
  mbox.poll() before mbox.receive() to ensure that there's a message
  waiting to be read, you may wish to define SPREAD_DISCONNECT_RACE_BUG
  when compiling spreadmodule.c.  Defining SPREAD_DISCONNECT_RACE_BUG
  causes all Spread calls via a given mbox to be serialized, so can
  cause deadlock if an mbox.receive() waits for a message to be sent
  by another thread in the same process via the same mbox.


Release 1.1: changes since release 1.0
--------------------------------------

- The README recommend using 3.16.2rc1 or later.

- Using Spread 3.16.2, it now works on Windows.

- Changes to the test suite to make it less accident-prone.

- Fixed race conditions having to do with disconnects in
  multi-threaded programs.  When one of the errors CONNECTION_CLOSED
  or ILLEGAL_SESSION is received, mark the mbox as closed.  In
  addition, use a lock to serialize access to the disconnected flag.

- Fixed a memory leak that leaked about 50 bytes per mbox.receive()
  call.
